This project is built using Tailwind CSS, making it fully responsive across all devices. It features a simple FM-style music player with two audio tracks available for listening. This is just a demo project created for fun, and there is still a lot to be done to improve and expand its functionality. You can experiment with it, add new features, and make it even better!
